# Native Codex Support

Clade supports Codex through a native plugin and, for external MCP clients, a
selectable Codex execution runtime. The native plugin is the recommended path
because its skills execute in the current Codex thread without spawning a
nested agent CLI.

## Install from GitHub

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add shenxingy/Clade
codex plugin add clade@clade
```

Start a new Codex thread after installation. Run `/hooks` once, review the two
Clade hook definitions, and trust them if they match the checked-in files.

For local development from a Clade checkout:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /absolute/path/to/Clade
codex plugin add clade@clade
```

## What Is Native

The plugin under `plugins/clade/` contains:

- 26 core workflows: commit, Codex usage pace, security review, release documentation, frontend
  design, local CI repair, handoff/pickup, incident response, investigation, architecture maps,
  PR review/merge, research, retrospectives, project review, sync, verification,
  worktrees, and supporting decision workflows.
- A `SessionStart` hook that injects concise branch, recent-commit, dirty-tree,
  handoff, repository-guidance, and delivery-completion context without mutating
  the repository.
- A `PreToolUse` safety hook that blocks catastrophic deletion, destructive SQL,
  migrations, and force-pushes to shared branches. Feature-branch force pushes
  are rewritten to `--force-with-lease`.

Codex loads executable workflow instructions from `SKILL.md`, while Clade's
original Claude distribution executes `prompt.md`. The generator combines both
canonical sources and applies Codex compatibility rules:

```bash
python3 configs/scripts/regen-codex-plugin.py
python3 configs/scripts/regen-codex-plugin.py --check
```

Edit canonical skills under `configs/skills/`, not the generated copies under
`plugins/clade/skills/`. Curated membership lives in
`plugins/clade/skills.list`.

`$clade:green` is portable outside the Clade repository. Its generated skill
bundles a byte-identical copy of `configs/scripts/ci-local.py`, resolves that
copy from the installed plugin root, and derives the target repository's real
GitHub Actions jobs before attempting a repair.

## Claude-to-Codex Migration Contract

Clade does not bulk-import the full Claude installation into Codex. That would
duplicate native plugin skills and would copy hooks, agents, output styles, and
state paths whose lifecycle or trust semantics differ between runtimes.

The machine-readable [`configs/codex-migration.json`](../configs/codex-migration.json)
records every configuration surface as native, a native subset, a semantic
adaptation, or an intentional exclusion. It also classifies every canonical
Claude skill exactly once: either it appears in `plugins/clade/skills.list`, or
it matches one documented exclusion group. CI fails when a new skill is added
without an explicit Codex disposition.

The installer adapts the provider-neutral parts of Clade's global policy into
the managed block in `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`: atomic PR scope, local-CI-first
verification, evidence completeness, concise response register, configuration
wiring, and deployment proof. It leaves model selection, trust, permissions,
MCP authentication, and personal plugin settings under the user's own
`~/.codex/config.toml`.

Claude output styles have no distributable one-to-one Codex primitive. Their
Evidence First and Terse invariants are therefore carried as durable Codex
guidance, without claiming system-prompt equivalence. Claude lifecycle
orchestration and the MCP bridge stay outside the native plugin until they have
real native semantics.

## State and Guidance

Codex resolves agent instructions per scope, first filename wins, with no
merge between them: `AGENTS.override.md` is probed before `AGENTS.md` at both
home scope (`~/.codex/`) and project scope, so wherever an override exists that
directory's `AGENTS.md` is not read at all. `CLAUDE.md` is Clade's own legacy
fallback for older Clade-enabled repositories, not a filename Codex itself
resolves. Because the managed block is merged into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`,
`install.sh` warns when `~/.codex/AGENTS.override.md` would shadow it; it
reports the conflict and never deletes or moves the override.

New runtime state is written under `.clade/` or `~/.clade/`; native workflows
may read legacy Claude state when migrating an existing project but do not
create new vendor-specific state.

Every generated native skill also ends with the same delivery boundary: a
writable task cannot report `DONE` with task-owned uncommitted changes, and a
live-URL or deployed-service request cannot be silently downgraded to local-only
work. Missing publication/deployment authority is reported as a blocker rather
than a completion caveat.

Explicit native skill invocation uses Codex's `$skill-name` form, for example:

```text
$clade:investigate why the integration test hangs
$clade:verify all behavior anchors
$clade:review the whole project and fix failures until clean
```

Natural-language activation works too.

## Codex Usage and Status Line

Clade 0.3 adds a native `$clade:codex-usage` workflow. It reads rate-limit snapshots
through the authenticated `codex app-server` protocol, so it never opens or
prints `~/.codex/auth.json`.

```text
$clade:codex-usage
$clade:codex-usage setup minimal
$clade:codex-usage style icon
$clade:codex-usage style detail
$clade:codex-usage theme bird
$clade:codex-usage --json
```

The default `minimal` view is deliberately terse:

```text
xingyushen git:(main)-9% (6d)
```

It contains project, branch, pace versus a 95% utilization target, and reset
time. `style icon` inserts the selected theme symbol; `style detail` expands all
available Codex limit buckets and percentages. Plain `setup` safely merges the
native `five-hour-limit` and `weekly-limit` footer fields into
`~/.codex/config.toml`. `setup minimal` selects the short project name, branch,
and the weekly limit; `setup full` also shows model, context, and both limit
windows. The project name is used instead of the full working-directory path
because the Codex footer truncates from the right, and a long path would push the
weekly-limit usage figure off-screen. Only the explicit layout commands replace
the existing `status_line` array.

Codex also provides `/usage` for its built-in account view, `/status` for the
current session, and `/statusline` for interactive footer configuration. Start
a new Codex session after changing the footer. Codex's native footer accepts a
fixed list of fields rather than an arbitrary formatter command, so the exact
Clade compact string is produced by `$clade:codex-usage`; the persistent footer uses
the closest native field combination.

## MCP 0.2.0 Runtime Selection

For Cursor, Windsurf, or another MCP client that should delegate Clade skills to
Codex, configure the `clade-mcp` server with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "clade": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["clade-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CLADE_RUNTIME": "codex",
        "CLADE_CODEX_SANDBOX": "workspace-write"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Supported runtime settings:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CLADE_RUNTIME` | `claude` | `claude`, `codex`, or conservative `auto` selection |
| `CLADE_CODEX_SANDBOX` | `workspace-write` | Codex sandbox for delegated skill execution |
| `CLADE_CODEX_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS` | unset | Set to `1` only in an externally isolated environment |

Do not configure this MCP server inside Codex when the native plugin is enabled.
Doing so duplicates tool descriptions and turns a native workflow into a nested
`codex exec` session.

See the [MCP package guide](../mcp-package/README.md) for the complete bundled
skill catalog and upgrade instructions.

## Codex as a Worker Provider (orchestrator)

The FastAPI orchestrator can run its pool workers on `codex exec` as a
first-class backend, not just via manual orchestration. `worker_provider.py`
abstracts *which* agent CLI a worker runs (parallel to `execution_backend.py`,
which abstracts *how* a process is spawned). Because a worker's completion is
process exit and its results come from `git diff` of the worktree — both
provider-agnostic — a Codex worker flows through the same WorkerPool, oracle
gate, and `WorkerEnvelope` pipeline as a Claude worker.

Select it globally or per task:

| Where | Key | Values |
|-------|-----|--------|
| `~/.claude/orchestrator-settings.json` | `worker_provider` | `claude` (default) · `codex` |
| task row | `provider` | overrides the setting for one task |
| task row | `effort` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max` |
| task row | `route_reason` | resolved audit reason, written at worker start |

The Codex worker runs `codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox
"$(cat <task>)" < /dev/null` (the worktree is throwaway and the oracle gate
still guards every merge; `< /dev/null` is mandatory — `codex exec` otherwise
blocks on stdin EOF and hangs). An explicit Codex model id (`gpt-*`, `o4-*`,
`codex-*`) is passed with `-m`; a Claude alias means "use the `~/.codex`
default". The default `claude` path is byte-identical to before — verified by
`tests/test_worker_provider.py`. Codex effort is passed as
`-c 'model_reasoning_effort="…"'`; Claude uses `--effort` and omits it for
Haiku, which does not support the control.

With `auto_model_routing` enabled, high-readiness Codex tasks use
`codex_cheap_model` (`gpt-5.6-terra` by default), while critical-path or
low-readiness tasks use `codex_strong_model` (`gpt-5.6-sol` by default).
Routing remains off by default until replay evaluation demonstrates that both
verified success per dollar and per wall-hour hold for a task class.

`./install.sh` also installs two native profiles under `~/.codex/agents/` and
merges an idempotent managed block into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` without replacing
user instructions. The block carries both adaptive-delegation rules and the
delivery-completion invariant. The lead keeps architecture and
ambiguous/high-risk work, delegates bounded read-only discovery to
`clade_cheap_explorer`, and uses `clade_cheap_worker` only with explicit file
ownership and a deterministic verifier. Spark is not assumed or installed as
the cheap tier because its availability is plan-dependent.

**Phase 2 (not yet wired):** consume `codex exec --json` JSONL (persist
`thread_id` from `thread.started`), enforce `--output-schema` on the result and
capture it into `completion_summary`, and resume a thread by id on retry instead
of a fresh run. Cancellation already works (the process-group kill is
provider-agnostic) and per-machine usage is tracked separately by `ccusage`.

## Compatibility Boundary

Claude-specific agents, the provider switcher, cross-machine usage aggregation,
and correction-learning hooks still depend on the Claude CLI layer. They remain
outside the native plugin rather than being presented as native while secretly
invoking Claude.

Worker **command construction, model resolution, and cancellation** are now
provider-neutral (see above); the remaining Codex-worker gaps before the
orchestrator layer is fully provider-neutral are **JSONL event streaming,
thread resume semantics, and structured-result/usage accounting** — tracked as
Phase 2 in `worker_provider.py`.
