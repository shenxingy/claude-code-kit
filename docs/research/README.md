# Research Index — What We've Already Studied

The two docs work as a pair:

- **[who-to-learn-from.md](../who-to-learn-from.md)** = the **watch-list** (WHO to learn from, incl. frontier sources we have *not* read yet).
- **This file** = the **deep-dives we've completed** + their **open gap backlog** — the surface to actually start implementing from.

Each deep-dive in this folder has YAML frontmatter (`status`, `summary`, `integrated_items`, `needs_work_items`). This index rolls that up so you don't re-read 30 KB to find what's left to do. **Source of truth is each doc's frontmatter** — when you close a gap, update the doc, then refresh this index.

> **2026-07-28 closeout:** the historical per-document gap counts below are
> research provenance, not an executable queue. Every unconditional item
> promoted by the July re-screen has landed: MCP v2, redaction, immutable
> evidence, human-reviewed eval learning/metrics, routing replay/cascade/
> break-even, provider registry/conformance, compatibility retirement,
> evidence-qualified North Star, and provider-neutral positioning. The
> authoritative remaining entries in [`TODO.md`](../../TODO.md) are explicitly
> conditional watches; the server rollout and branch cleanup are complete. Do
> not reopen the historical lists without new evidence.

- **Last reviewed:** 2026-07-28 (full expert/project re-screen and backlog reconciliation; prior 2026-07-15) · **Cadence:** refresh when a deep-dive's `status` changes or a new one lands.

**Status:** ✅ integrated (absorbed) · 📘 reference (studied, nothing to build) · 🔨 needs_work (open gaps)

## Where we're weakest (theme view)

The gaps cluster into 5 themes. This is the strategic read — *where the most external lessons point at the same Clade weakness.*

> ⚠️ **2026-06-13 code-audit reconciliation.** The themes below were drafted from the April research docs. A grep+spot-check audit of `orchestrator/` found **most small/medium items already implemented** (several carry gap-citing docstrings like `(Sweep §Gap2)` / `Multi-agent Gap 3` — prior loop work that never got back-filled here). The heat ratings describe where the *lessons* converge, not where Clade is still weak today. **Genuinely-open items are the short list in the [backlog callout](#open-gap-backlog-by-effort) below — trust that, not the per-theme "start here" notes.**

| Theme | Our gap (in one line) | Sources pushing on it | Heat |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|------|
| **Fault localization / context retrieval** | Clade injects one flat TLDR blob; no ranked "suspect files→methods→lines", no iterative narrowing, no semantic search | Aider (PageRank+tree-sitter), Agentless (hierarchical JSON localize), AutoCodeRover (AST search APIs + SBFL), Moatless (typed search, span budgeting), Sweep (AST bipartite) | 🔥🔥🔥 hottest — 5 sources, our biggest deficit vs SWE-bench scaffolds |
| **Reflection / retry loop** | Clade retries one-shot (re-runs whole subprocess); no failure-mode memory, no repro-test patch filter, no minimal-patch targeting, no constitutional re-check | Aider (3× reflection), Agentless (repro-test filter), AutoCodeRover (cheap LLM-only retry), Reflexion/Self-RAG (episodic memory, minimal patch, constitutional, spec checklist), Sweep (test runner) | 🔥🔥🔥 most 🟢 cheap wins — start here for momentum |
| **Context compression / layering** | TLDR only; no structured condenser strategies, no L1/L2/L3 tiers, no per-span token budget | OpenHands (9 condensers), Aider (ChatChunks layering), Moatless (token budgeting) | 🔥🔥 |
| **Hooks / spec scaffolding** | Hooks don't rewrite-on-block, aren't matcher-scoped, don't persist allow-rules; no source-traced TODOs / VERIFY invariants (Stop + PostToolUseFailure hooks now exist) | Kiro (enhanced stop hook, EARS invariants, traced TODOs), Claude Code hook docs (input rewrite, async, matcher if) | 🔥🔥 |
| **PR-review / oracle craft** | Oracle is single-pass; large diffs truncated at 3000 chars (auto-approve risk); no per-finding fixes or confidence; worker state lost on restart (no event replay) | Qodo Merge (diff chunking, 2-pass, per-finding, confidence), Reflection (per-dimension fixes), Composio (reaction system), OpenHands (EventStream) | 🔥🔥 |

**Takeaway:** strategically, **fault localization** is the deepest deficit (5 sources, needs a real index) — the high-value bet. Tactically, **reflection/retry** and **hooks** hold the most 🟢 cheap wins — start there for momentum, then commit to the fault-localization track.

## Index of deep-dives

Grouped by [watch-list](../who-to-learn-from.md) tier. `Gaps` = count of open `needs_work_items`.

### Codex GPT-5.6 generation (2026-09-05)
| Source | Status | Gaps | Core lesson | Doc |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|-----|
| **openai/codex @ `4df8027a97`, the live model catalog, this host's Codex databases** | 🔨 | 4 | Reading upstream mattered less than re-reading ourselves. Almost nothing in the GPT-5.6 generation is a capability this toolkit lacks; what the sweep found is **three things this repository had written down that are false**. Both destructive-command guardians allow every recursive delete an agent actually writes — variable, command-substitution and glob targets all pass, while the literal forms are blocked. "Codex cannot fan out" is wrong and is encoded three times (a capability declaration, the tests pinning it, an open roadmap item), disproved by two spawn edges in this host's database and then reproduced live. The cheap Codex tier is set to the catalog's middle tier. What IS new upstream and worth naming: `ultra` is an effort level meaning automatic delegation, not a model; every 5.6 model is `code_mode_only`; and the base prompt traded engineering advice for a request-verb authority envelope and a destructive-action protocol | [→](2026-09-05-codex-gpt56-and-harness-review.md) |

### Agent orchestration efficiency (2026-09-02)
| Source | Status | Gaps | Core lesson | Doc |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|-----|
| **Our own 89 workflow runs** | 🔨 | 3 | The process data was already being written and nothing had ever read it. Measured across 89 parallel runs (1777 agents, 49.9h): **45% of all makespan was spent with exactly one agent still running**. Agent count is not the problem — barriers are. A 110-agent `pipeline()` scored 80% utilisation with a **0%** tail despite a 6.9x straggler spread; a 10-agent `parallel()` barrier scored 55% with a 19% tail. A pipeline absorbs variance; a barrier converts it into idle capacity. Also measured: 25% of the lead session's shell calls were pure status polls | [→](2026-09-02-agent-orchestration-efficiency.md) |

### Ecosystem audit (2026-08-29)
| Source | Status | Gaps | Core lesson | Doc |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|-----|
| **Three rounds + doc audit** | 🔨 | 10 | Almost nothing upstream was a capability Clade lacked; ~90 candidates yielded 20 defects **in Clade**, nearly all of one shape — a control that exists, is documented as working, and never applies. The counter is a gate that RUNS the real thing (load the plugin, read the workflow files, compare `_SETTINGS_DEFAULTS`, run a positive/negative control) rather than asserting about it. Four open decisions are in [TODO.md](../../TODO.md); the eight adversarially-rejected candidates are recorded so they are not re-proposed | [→](2026-08-29-ecosystem-audit.md) |

### OpenAI + frontier sweep (2026-07-15)
| Source | Status | Gaps | Core lesson | Doc |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|-----|

## Open-gap backlog (by effort)

> ### ✅ 2026-06-18 — full reconciliation + cleared the research backlog (19 study agents)
>
> Two sweeps in one session: (1) re-verified every `needs_work` deep-dive item-by-item against `orchestrator/` + `configs/` (51 tracked "gaps" across 12 docs → most were already built in prior loop work, never back-filled); (2) deep-dived all **6 remaining watch-list frontier sources** so the research backlog is now empty.
>
> **What got built this sweep** (6 items, all tested — commits `2c034eb`, `32556fd`, `49af13e`):
> - **Worker commit-type classifier** (`config._infer_commit_type`) — stop hardcoding `feat:`; a real bug that *zeroed the agent fix-rate metric* (`commit-archeology.sh` keys `fix` off `/^fix/`, so every agent fix counted as a feat → `0/N`). [Agent-Fingerprint]
> - **Acceptance-criteria extraction** (`worker_hydrate._extract_acceptance_criteria`) — lift done-criteria out of a hydrated issue body into a first-class contract callout. [Reflection §G5]
> - **Loop iteration-start health check** + **per-iteration fix-rate metric** (loop-runner.sh). [Anthropic · last-mile]
> - **Test-inclusion signal** (PR body + commit-archeology dimension). [Agent-Fingerprint]
> - **Read-only judge hardening** — wired `DISALLOWED_TOOLS_JUDGE` to 5 judge spawns that had it defined-but-not-called. [opencode]
>
> **Closed as already-built / different-not-deficient:** Moatless StringReplace discipline (false open — `EDIT_DISCIPLINE_BLOCK` worker_utils.py:50 already wired); Aider tree-sitter index (on-demand `clade_search_*` + grep cover it at <500-file scale; Sonar validates simple-tools-win); Qodo audience-diff (autonomous = no author/reviewer split); 12-Factor Factor-7 (outer-loop human contact already exists). Sonar + Ralph + 12-Factor land as **endorsements** of Clade's design, not gaps.
>
> **Then built the last 4 too (commits `32556fd`, `49af13e`) — backlog is now empty:**
>
> | Gap | Source | What shipped |
> |-----|--------|------|
> | Iteration-start health check | Anthropic | `node_health_check` in loop-runner.sh — verify_cmd at iteration start, broken baseline folded into supervisor context for repair-first |
> | Test-inclusion signal | Agent-Fingerprint | `tests_added` → PR body (`_build_pr_body`) + `detect_agent_test_inclusion` in commit-archeology.sh |
> | Fix-Rate per-iteration metric | last-mile | pytest failed-count delta per iteration → `fix-rate.tsv`, summarized in the loop report |
> | Read-only judge hardening | opencode | wired `DISALLOWED_TOOLS_JUDGE` to the verify + session supervisor/decompose/suggest judges (was defined-but-not-called) — stronger than a deny-list |
>
> **Net for the whole sweep: 0 open gaps across all 23 deep-dives.** Two latent bugs caught and fixed along the way: the always-`feat:` commit type (zeroed the fix-rate metric), and a YAML duplicate-key in `reflection-agents.md` (second `integrated_items:` block clobbered the first). +19 new tests, full suite green (623).
>
> ### 🔬 2026-06-18 — adversarial re-review of the "different-not-deficient" rulings
>
> The sweep above had a confirmation bias: agents incentivized to *close* gaps tend to rationalize SKIPs. So 4 adversarial agents re-attacked every "different-not-deficient" ruling — verify the claimed alternative is actually *in code*, then steelman the expert. Most held (Localize→Repair→Validate, Qodo audience, provider scope, warm-pool, ChatChunks, greenfield init — genuinely different). But the review **overturned 3 rationalizations, found 1 bug, and corrected several over-claims** — all now built:
>
> | Finding | Was claimed | Reality (audit) | Fix |
> |---------|-------------|-----------------|-----|
> | **SWE-bench eval** | "`run_oracle_eval` already covers it" | FALSE — that measures judge *accuracy* + parser robustness, **zero** end-to-end resolution. The whole study's parity was *reasoning, not measurement*; the SKIP protected it from being tested. | `evals/run_resolve_eval.py` — SWE-bench-Lite pipeline + dry-run self-test (`a1272c2`). **Run it for a real number.** |
> | **Patch-sampling** | "iterate covers sampling's benefit" | Rationalization — in-process retry is **lint-only**, the diverse-sample escape shipped **disabled** (`parallel_fix_samples=1`) AND **unreachable** (`is_critical_path` never auto-set), no selection. | plateau-triggered diverse fan-out on the 2nd oracle rejection (`8e47313`). |
> | **PageRank repo-map** | "LLM selection ≈ PageRank" | Cruder — non-deterministic haiku + keyword-substring, no graph centrality; central-but-keyword-poor files missed. | deterministic import-graph PageRank centrality (`d389ed0`). |
> | **`blocked` task** (bug) | — | `_check_blockers` set `blocked`, which **no path could requeue** → orphaned forever. | retry accepts `blocked` (`f0c519a`). |
> | over-claim: "SBFL" | spectrum/Ochiai | traceback-*frequency* | now counts **distinct failing tests** + honest label (`d389ed0`). |
> | over-claim: localizer window | covers the repo | `tldr[:3000]` truncated the relevant file out | 3000→8000 (`d389ed0`). |
> | over-claim: AST search | covers the codebase | Python AST real, **JS/TS was regex** | widened JS/TS parse: interface/type/enum/arrow/export/methods (`d389ed0`). |
>
> **Honest bottom line:** "0 open gaps" is now backed by *builds + a real eval harness*, not just reasoning — but **true parity with the experts is still unproven until `run_resolve_eval.py` is run on real SWE-bench instances** (needs the claude CLI + per-instance Docker envs). The number, not the argument, is the last mile.
>
> ### 🎯 2026-06-18 — live resolve runs (first real datapoints) + multi-language unlock
>
> First end-to-end resolve runs of Clade's worker loop on **real sibling repos** (planted bug → worker `claude -p` → score against FAIL_TO_PASS/PASS_TO_PASS, neither touched a test file):
> - **owlcast (Python)** — planted `_pick_video_file` selection bug → **RESOLVED in 33s** (worker re-derived the exact correct one-liner).
> - **faker-100 (TypeScript)** — planted `classifyPlatform` `&&`→`||` bug → **RESOLVED in 86s** (auto-committed the fix).
>
> Honest scope: both are *easy 1-line bugs* and prove the **loop works end-to-end on a real codebase**, not a SWE-bench-comparable resolve-rate. Notable finding: Clade's Python scaffolding (SBFL/repro) **didn't contribute** — SBFL is blind to *assertion* failures (no impl frame in the traceback), and the haiku localizer fell back to the full map. The worker won on the model's own navigation + a clear symptom + the TLDR.
>
> **Multi-language unlock (B):** Clade was BLIND on non-Python/JS repos (empty TLDR). Now `worker_tldr._parse_with_treesitter` gives real AST signatures for Go/Rust/Java/Ruby/C/C++/C#/PHP via lazy tree-sitter grammars (optional + graceful; `requirements-treesitter.txt`), JS/TS stay on the tuned regex. Verified on real sibling code (companyOS TS schemas, Go AST). This is the audit's "for a multi-lang shop, tree-sitter is the real answer" — now built (`efabb1e`/`0755765`).
>
> ### 🌍 2026-06-19 — localization scaffolding completed to fully multi-language
>
> The TLDR was multi-language (B) but **SBFL/PageRank were still Python-only** (live-run finding). Now closed:
> - **Assertion-aware SBFL** (`6d2785e`) — fixes the owlcast blind spot: an `assert foo(x)==y` failure leaves no impl frame, so SBFL surfaced nothing. Now parses the failing test's AST for the impl symbols it asserts on. Benefits Python *and* generalizes.
> - **Multi-language SBFL** (`422e761`) — new `fault_localize` leaf: detect the runner (orchestrator.json `test_cmd` / sniff), parse Go panics + JS/TS stack frames (vitest/jest/node:test) + language-agnostic assertion fallback. Live-verified on node:test.
> - **Multi-language PageRank** (`f4f7a5d`, `270c86e`) — cross-language import graph (Python/Go/Rust/JS-TS/Java, + tsconfig `@/` path aliases) so central files surface in non-Python repos.
> - **Adversarial review** (35-agent workflow) found **30 verified issues; 24 fixed** (`9069763`) — Go-generics + a real ReDoS in the panic-frame regex, test-file detection by naming convention (not the "test" substring), unittest/assert-helper filtering, Rust grouped/crate-only imports, commented-import stripping, cache-invalidation-on-delete, Python-repo-with-package.json misroute. The ~6 deferred are perf micro-opts + rare edge cases. **679 tests green.**
>
> Honest scope: this strengthens localization on *hard* non-Python bugs. The two live resolve runs (easy 1-line bugs) didn't exercise it — the SWE-bench-comparable resolve-rate (run `evals/run_resolve_eval.py`) remains the real parity proof.
>
> ---
>
> ✅ **Reconciled against code 2026-06-13.** A direct audit of `orchestrator/` found the overwhelming majority of the small + medium items below **already implemented** — episodic failure memory, minimal-patch retry, acceptance-criteria checklist, post-worker test runner, caller hints, diff chunking, confidence scoring, two-pass oracle, entity-level TLDR pruning, all four hook items, and more (many cite their source gap in-code). **Do not build from the lists below without re-grepping first — they predate the audit.**
>
> **Final dispositions after deep study (2026-06-14, 4 parallel study agents + code review):**
> | Item | Source | Disposition |
> |------|--------|-------------|
> | Constitutional check vs CLAUDE.md | Reflection §G4 | ✅ **DONE** (a56d921 + 7d50b0c) — CLAUDE.md "Code Rules" injected into oracle quality + chunked passes; wired in both `_run_oracle_gate` and `oracle_cli.py`. |
> | Reproduction-test filter | Agentless §6B | ✅ **DONE** (601bd9b + 7d50b0c) — Clade already *generated* a confirmed-failing repro then threw it away; now persisted (task-id namespaced) + re-run post-fix, result feeds oracle evidence, hard-block behind `repro_test_gate`. |
> | Split retrieve(P1)/patch(P2) | AutoCodeRover | ❌ **SKIP different-not-deficient** — soft two-phase directive already injected (`worker_taskfile.py:269`); hard process-split forces context re-hydration the native single-context loop avoids. |
> | Localize→Repair→Validate phases | Agentless | ❌ **SKIP different-not-deficient** — localize + validate already deterministic phases; making *repair* non-agentic discards the native navigate/edit/verify loop (Agentless's split only existed to stop weak models distracting themselves). |
> | 7 callable AST search APIs | AutoCodeRover | ❌ **SKIP already-equivalent** — `clade_search_class/method/code` exist + wired (`mcp_server.py:337`); the residual 4 are file-scoped variants subsumed by native Grep/Read-with-path. |
> | Embedding semantic index (FAISS+Voyage) | Moatless | ❌ **SKIP different-not-deficient** — paid API + doubled deps + stale-on-every-commit for negligible gain at <500-file scale (doc's own words: "overkill"); 3/4 search actions already exist as tools. |
> | SBFL / Ochiai pre-pass | AutoCodeRover | ✅ **ALREADY-DONE** — `_sbfl_prepass` (traceback-frequency proxy, `worker_tldr.py:659`); prior grep was a false negative. |
> | SWE-bench eval harness | Moatless | ❌ **SKIP different-not-deficient** — Clade-shaped eval already exists (`evals/run_oracle_eval.py`); SWE-bench measures the wrong thing for a general loop tool. |
>
> **Net: of 7 studied items, 2 were genuinely deficient and are now built; 5 were already-done or different-not-deficient.** Newly-found gaps (separate from this cluster) — all now resolved:
> - ✅ **`test-baseline.json` swarm race** — FIXED (be1e980): namespaced to `test-baseline-{task_id}.json`, same pattern as the repro filter.
> - ✅ **`_sbfl_prepass` had no unit test** — ADDED (94a77ab); the test caught a real bug (traceback regex matched newlines → suspect-ranking corrupted across keys), fixed in the same commit.
> - ❌ **Parallel patch-sampling + majority-vote re-rank** (Agentless Opp. C) — **SKIP, different-not-deficient + cost.** Agentless sampled 40 patches for a one-shot benchmark with a weak base model maximizing pass@1. Clade has a strong base model that already *iterates* (reflection retry w/ episodic memory + minimal-patch targeting) and *verifies* (oracle gate → requeue, repro-test filter) — covering sampling's core benefit (escaping one bad attempt) without the N× per-task token cost. `swarm.py` is a worker-pool manager, not a candidate sampler. Revisit only if we observe tasks where sequential iteration *plateaus* on the same wrong approach — then a diverse multi-angle attempt (judge-panel pattern) is the lever, as an opt-in for hard tasks, not a default.

The lists below are the **pre-audit** backlog, kept for provenance. Cheapest first; re-grep each before building.

### 🟢 Small (cheap wins — start here), grouped by sub-theme

**Reflection / retry**
- ⭐ **[Reflection]** Episodic failure memory — a "Failure Analysis" block (what was tried / why it failed / what to change) in the retry prompt, haiku-generated from lint+oracle output. *Flagged highest-value-smallest-effort.* → `worker.py`.
- **[Reflection]** Minimal-patch reflection — parse lint for `file:line`, then `--continue` with "fix this specific error only, change nothing else." Stops needless full rewrites.
- **[Reflection]** Spec-driven acceptance-criteria checklist — extract "Acceptance Criteria"/"Definition of Done" from pre-hydrated issues, append to the task file. → `_pre_hydrate`.

**Fault localization / retrieval**
- **[AutoCodeRover]** Patch-validation retry budget — retry only the patch-gen LLM call (≤3×), not the whole subprocess. → `worker.py`.
- **[AutoCodeRover]** Explicit exploration cap + LLM "sufficient context" signal before patching (caps at 10 rounds).
- **[Moatless]** Two-phase search-then-identify — secondary haiku distills large result sets before injection. → `worker_tldr.py`.
- **[Moatless]** StringReplace edit-validation discipline (uniqueness + line-number stripping) in the worker **system prompt** — no code change.
- **[Sweep]** Post-worker functional test runner — `test_cmd` in orchestrator config, run after commit, feed failures into retry.
- **[Sweep]** Call-site dependency hints — grep callers of changed functions → "if you change X, also update these." Plain Bash.

**Oracle / PR review**
- **[Qodo]** Diff chunking for diffs >3000 chars — prevents truncated large refactors from auto-approving. → `_oracle_review`.
- **[Qodo]** Confidence-scored findings (high/medium/low per dimension) so the worker fixes high-confidence first.

**Hooks**
- **[Claude-hooks]** Async PostToolUse — `async:true` on formatting/notification hooks to kill per-edit latency (verify current flag).
- **[Claude-hooks]** Input rewriting (`git push -f` → `--force-with-lease`) via `updatedInput` instead of a hard block.
- **[Claude-hooks]** Matcher `if` to skip `pre-tool-guardian.sh` on safe Bash calls.
- **[Claude-hooks]** Persistent allow-rules via `updatedPermissions` to stop reprompting known-safe patterns.

### 🟡 Medium
- **[Agentless]** Hierarchical localization as **structured JSON** ("suspect files→classes→lines") before repair.
- **[Agentless]** Patch sampling + majority-vote re-ranking (N haiku candidates, pick via oracle).
- **[Agentless]** Reproduction-test generation as a patch filter — *highest fix-quality lever in the cluster.* → `worker.py` verify.
- **[AutoCodeRover]** Split context-retrieval (Phase 1) from patch-gen (Phase 2) — freeze context before patching.
- **[AutoCodeRover]** Method-granularity search (full bodies ±3 lines) vs signature-only TLDR.
- **[Moatless]** Span-level FileContext with per-span token budgeting + eviction.
- **[Moatless]** Typed search actions (FindClass/FindFunction/SemanticSearch) in worker system prompt.
- **[Moatless]** `max_tokens_per_worker` budget — orchestrator doesn't observe worker token usage. → `config.py`.
- **[Sweep]** Entity-level TLDR pruning — filter TLDR to issue-relevant entities (3-5× less noise).
- **[Sweep]** Hybrid context retrieval — keyword grep + structural haiku in `_localize_tldr_for_task`.
- **[Qodo + Reflection]** Per-finding / per-dimension targeted fixes — `findings:[{dimension,severity,fix_suggestion}]`; worker applies in order. *(These two overlap — build once.)*
- **[Qodo]** Two-pass oracle — spec-adherence check then quality/bug check, reconciled.
- **[Reflection]** Constitutional check after generation — haiku validates the diff against CLAUDE.md "Code Rules" before commit.

### 🔴 Large (architectural)
- **[Agentless]** Localize→Repair→Validate as explicit first-class phases (we run one end-to-end worker pass).
- **[AutoCodeRover]** Structured AST search APIs exposed to the agent (7 callable tools).
- **[AutoCodeRover]** Spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL / Ochiai scores) as a pre-pass hint.
- **[Moatless]** Embedding-based semantic search index (FAISS + tree-sitter + Voyage).
- **[Moatless]** SWE-bench evaluation harness (no benchmark harness today → can't measure worker quality).

### 🔵 Low (deprioritized)
- **[Qodo]** PR-review audience differentiation (author vs reviewer comments) — author flagged low priority for autonomous flows.

### ⚪ Untagged (need a sizing pass)
*Many cluster into the themes above — Aider reflection → reflection theme, OpenHands condensers → context-compression, Kiro stop hook → hooks.*
- **[Aider]** multi-cycle reflection loop · L1/L2/L3 ChatChunks layering · PageRank `/map` · tree-sitter indexing · adaptive repo-map sizing
- **[Kiro]** source-traced TODOs (`_From: GOALS.md §X.Y`) · conditional CLAUDE.md inclusion by file type · enhanced stop hook (security/spec/coverage) · VERIFY.md invariants · worker-scoped steering files
- **[OpenHands]** EventStream replayable state (fault tolerance) · structured condenser strategies
- **[Composio]** PR-review reaction system (→ `github_sync.py`) · activity detection via Claude JSONL
- **[LangGraph]** interrupt() human-in-loop breakpoints · Send API map-reduce dispatch

## Research backlog — watch-list entries not yet deep-dived

✅ **Empty as of 2026-06-18.** The 6 frontier sources that previously lived here were all deep-dived this sweep — see the [Frontier sources](#frontier-sources-studied-2026-06-18--cleared-the-research-backlog) table above:

- ✅ **Anthropic "Effective harnesses for long-running agents"** (Tier 1) → [doc](2026-06-18-anthropic-effective-harnesses.md) · 0 gaps — iteration-start health check now built.
- ✅ **Sonar Foundation Agent** → [doc](2026-06-18-sonar-foundation-agent.md) · 0 gaps — endorses Clade's iterating-loop design.
- ✅ **SST opencode** → [doc](2026-06-18-sst-opencode.md) · 0 gaps — read-only judge hardening now wired.
- ✅ **Geoffrey Huntley — Ralph/CURSED** → [doc](2026-06-18-huntley-ralph-cursed.md) · 0 gaps — confirms Ralph ≈ /loop.
- ✅ **12-Factor Agents** → [doc](2026-06-18-12-factor-agents.md) · 0 gaps — 11/12 + bonus covered.
- ✅ **Agent Fingerprint study** → [doc](2026-06-18-agent-fingerprint.md) · 0 gaps — commit-type bug fixed + test-inclusion signal built.

New frontier candidates land on the [watch-list](../who-to-learn-from.md); pull one here when it's worth a `/deep-research`.

## How to use this for a study session

1. Open the [theme view](#where-were-weakest-theme-view) → pick the hottest theme you have appetite for (default: **fault localization**).
2. Read the relevant deep-dive(s) for that theme.
3. Pull one item from the [backlog](#open-gap-backlog-by-effort) — prefer 🟢 small for a first win.
4. Apply the **"different ≠ deficient"** gate ([watch-list](../who-to-learn-from.md#how-we-vet-what-we-absorb)) — confirm it's a real deficit before building.
5. Build it (reversible — commit small), update the deep-dive's frontmatter (`needs_work_items` → `integrated_items`), then refresh this index's counts + `Last reviewed`.
