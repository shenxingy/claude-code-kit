# Root (/) matched with word-boundary-aware pattern: space+slash+(space|end|star)

# \b requires a word/non-word transition, and `~` is itself a non-word char, so
# `~\b` could never match `~` or `~/...` (it only matched nonsense like `~abc`)
# — i.e. `rm -rf ~` sailed straight through. Anchor it as a home reference
# instead: start/space/`=` before it, and `/`, whitespace, or end after the
# optional ~user part. That still lets a trailing-tilde backup file through
# (`rm -rf /tmp/file~`), which is not a home reference.

# Per-LINE matching was too coarse in both directions:
#   - False positive: `SRC=/home/me/.claude; rm -rf /tmp/shadow-test` blocked a
#     benign temp delete because a home path shared its line. Shell one-liners
#     chain statements with ; && || far more often than they use newlines, so
#     "only look at rm lines" did not actually isolate the rm.
#   - False negative direction: the three greps ran independently over the whole
#     set of rm lines, so `rm -r a` on one line plus `rm -f /home/b` on another
#     combined into a block that neither statement earned.
# `tr` (not sed \n, which BSD sed rejects) keeps this portable to macOS.

# ─── Recursive delete on a target the guardian cannot resolve ─────────
#
# The rule above matches the TEXT of the target, which is what a human types
# and not what an agent writes. Measured 2026-09-05: a recursive delete against
# $BUILD_DIR/, "$BUILD_DIR"/, ${OUT}/, $OUT/*, $(pwd)/* or a bare glob was
# ALLOWED by both guardians while every spelled-out form was blocked.
#
# What makes it dangerous is the shell lifecycle, not the regex. Each Bash tool
# call is a fresh shell, so a variable assigned in an earlier call is unset in
# this one and the target expands to the filesystem root — the very string the
# rule above exists to stop. GNU rm's --preserve-root does not save it either,
# because the expanded argument is root-plus-star rather than root.
#
# Two answers, because the two shapes differ in whether anything can be made
# safe:
#   a name  → rewrite $NAME to ${NAME:?...}. A set variable runs unchanged; an
#             unset one aborts naming itself. A correct command pays nothing.
#   no name → refuse. $(...) and a bare glob are decided at run time and there
#             is nothing to make required.
#
# Ordering matters: this runs AFTER the catastrophic-path block, so $HOME and
# the named system paths stay blocked rather than being rewritten into a
# "required" variable that is always set.

# A delete written inside a single-quoted string is text, not a command, and
# rewriting it would corrupt the string. Count the quotes that open before the
# first rm; an odd number means we are inside one.
