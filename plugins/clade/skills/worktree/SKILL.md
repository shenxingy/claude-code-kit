# Clade for Codex

This package composes the provider-neutral Clade core contract with the native
Codex surface adapter. Run the workflow directly in Codex; do not launch
another agent CLI or route it through Clade MCP.

Package provenance:

- core contract: `clade.delivery/v1`
- surface adapter: `codex/v1`
- explicit invocation: `$clade:worktree`
- generated from: `configs/skills/<name>`

## Canonical Clade workflow

You are the Worktree skill. Use the shared `delivery` context/state controller
and the current runtime surface overlay.

## Invariants

- One mutable branch per live session; one branch cannot be checked out in two
  worktrees.
- Parallel writers receive separate worktrees/clones/containers/detached
  snapshots and non-overlapping delivery units.
- Do not write tracked `TASK.md` or other Clade bookkeeping into an arbitrary
  repository. Task/ownership/progress live in Git-common delivery state.
- Completion publishes/reviews through repository policy; it does not locally
  merge every worktree into whichever branch happens to be active.
- Remove only a worktree and branch owned by the selected terminal delivery.

## Create

1. Run `delivery context` and inspect `git worktree list --porcelain`.
2. Resolve the real base/default branch and ensure the source tree has no
   unrelated dirty changes.
3. Choose the runtime-native isolation:
   - normal local Git: explicit worktree path plus owned topic branch;
   - Codex-managed worktree: detached start is valid; attach a branch only for
     preservation/publication;
   - cloud/CI: runtime-provided clone/container;
   - unsupported client: report required isolation instead of sharing a branch.
4. Create a delivery record containing task source, base SHA, owner, optional
   stack parent, runtime, surface, and publication authorities.
5. Pass the task through runtime-native context/handoff, not a tracked project
   file.

Before filesystem creation, resolve an explicit safe destination outside the
repository root. Never derive a destructive target from an empty variable,
home directory, workspace root, or broad glob.

## List

Combine:

- `git worktree list --porcelain`;
- active `delivery list`;
- each worktree's branch/detached HEAD, dirty state, owner, delivery state,
  base/head SHA, and last checkpoint.

Mark stale/prunable/unknown ownership; do not mutate it during list.

## Preserve/handoff

Before runtime termination, context switch, compaction, or provider handoff:

- commit coherent work and record focused checkpoint evidence;
- for detached committed work, run `delivery preserve-ref`;
- when commits are prohibited, run `delivery export-patch`;
- record reduced-fidelity handoff when native session resume is unavailable.

No worktree may be auto-removed while its head is unreachable or dirty state
lacks a patch/blocker.

## Integrate

Route the worktree's independently reviewable result through `$clade:create-pr`,
`$clade:review-pr`, and `$clade:merge-pr`. A throw-away integration worktree may test
several candidate heads, but durable work must never be based on it and it is
never itself merged as a product change.

For explicit stacks, record parent relationships, merge bottom-up, and restack
each child after parent ancestry changes.

## Clean

1. Re-probe worktrees and active delivery state.
2. Require the target delivery to be merged/abandoned or explicitly preserved.
3. Verify no dirty/unreachable work and no other live owner.
4. Remove the exact worktree path.
5. Delete only its exact owned local branch; delete remote only with authority.
6. prune stale metadata and run delivery cleanup verification where applicable.

Never use broad `--clean all`, branch-prefix glob deletion, or force removal
without resolving every target and its recovery state.

## Codex surface adapter

# Codex surface adapter

- Installed Clade plugin skills are namespaced. Invoke this workflow as
  `$clade:delivery`, and use `$clade:<skill-name>` for companion workflows.
- Read the closest applicable agent instructions. Codex probes
  `AGENTS.override.md` before `AGENTS.md` at each scope and does not merge
  them, so where an override exists that scope's `AGENTS.md` is not in effect.
  `CLAUDE.md` is Clade's legacy fallback rather than a filename Codex resolves;
  read it only when it is trusted repository guidance.
- Codex-managed worktrees may begin at detached HEAD. A local detached commit
  is valid, but create/attach an owned branch or preserve a reachable Clade ref
  before the runtime deletes the worktree.
- Inspect `git worktree list --porcelain` before checkout, rewrite, or cleanup:
  one branch cannot be checked out by multiple worktrees.
- Use Codex native review/worktree/handoff capabilities where available. Do
  not launch Claude Code or a nested Codex CLI to emulate the workflow.
- Project configuration is trust-gated. Provider credentials and user
  connections remain user-scoped and cannot be donated by repository files.

## Additional skill reference

# Worktree

Create or manage isolated agent workspaces without assuming every runtime uses
a sibling directory plus immediate branch. Worktree ownership is recorded in
the shared `$clade:delivery` state; independently reviewable work integrates through
the target repository's PR/queue policy, not an arbitrary local merge.

## Delivery completion

If this workflow changes files or external state:

- Inspect the real final state before responding, including `git status` for a
  repository task.
- Never report `DONE` while task-owned changes are uncommitted. Use or continue
  `$clade:delivery` and create a repository-compliant checkpoint or preserve
  the work when committing is unavailable.
- When the user request or trusted repository policy makes publication,
  deployment, or live verification part of the task, do not silently downgrade
  the result to local-only work.
- If a required delivery transition lacks authority, credentials, a destination,
  or reachable external state, report `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_CONTEXT` rather than
  appending a "not committed/pushed/deployed" caveat after `DONE`.
