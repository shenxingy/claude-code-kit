# Clade for Codex

This package composes the provider-neutral Clade core contract with the native
Codex surface adapter. Run the workflow directly in Codex; do not launch
another agent CLI or route it through Clade MCP.

Package provenance:

- core contract: `clade.delivery/v1`
- surface adapter: `codex/v1`
- explicit invocation: `$clade:commit`
- generated from: `configs/skills/<name>`

## Canonical Clade workflow

You are the Commit skill. Create repository-adaptive checkpoint commits for the
current coherent delivery slice.

## Arguments

- default: checkpoint locally; publish only when the active delivery record or
  repository policy already authorizes it
- `--publish`: user explicitly requests publishing the owned branch after green
  checkpoints
- `--candidate`: run complete candidate verification and bind it to exact HEAD
- `--dry-run`: show scope, verification, commit, and publication decisions only

## 1. Enter the shared delivery workflow

Locate the sibling `delivery` skill and read its prompt plus the relevant
surface overlay. Run its deterministic `context` and `list` commands.

Do not commit until:

- the current branch/detached checkout is identified;
- an active delivery owns the branch, or detached preservation is selected;
- unrelated dirty files are separated or explicitly dispositioned;
- trusted repository instructions and contribution policy are read.

If no record exists for a user-requested coding task, initialize one through
`delivery start`. Do not manufacture ownership from a branch-name prefix.

## 2. Scope the checkpoint

Inspect staged, unstaged, untracked, and commits since the resolved base. Group
files by coherent behavior/evidence slice—not merely file type.

One commit should leave a useful recovery point. Cross-layer behavior, its
tests, generated contracts, migrations, and supporting documentation normally
belong together. Unrelated fixes require another commit and usually another
delivery/PR.

Never make unrelated universal mutations such as adding README counts,
flowcharts, TODO entries, attribution trailers, or Conventional Commit syntax
unless the target repository requires them.

Check secret risk and refuse credentials, raw provider endpoints with secrets,
private keys, token files, or machine-local state.

## 3. Discover commit policy

Resolve, in precedence order:

1. explicit user constraints and hard safety;
2. trusted closest `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`;
3. `CONTRIBUTING*`, commit templates, hooks, pre-commit config, DCO/signing;
4. package/monorepo affected-test conventions;
5. conservative Clade defaults.

Do not bypass hooks with `--no-verify`. Do not invent Conventional Commits,
signoff, or signatures where the repository does not require them.

**Body mandate:** when the repository uses Conventional Commits, give
substantive `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`perf` commits a short body after a blank
line. Record the mechanism, the hazard avoided or root cause, and material
constraints honored. Trivial `chore`/`docs` commits may remain subject-only.
Never add attribution trailers unless repository policy requires them.

## 4. Verify at the right evidence level

For a normal checkpoint, run affected syntax/tests/lint/typecheck sufficient to
show this slice is coherent. Full CI is not a prerequisite for preserving
useful work.

For `--candidate`, first align/restack against the resolved intended base, then
run every repository-required build/test/generated-file gate on exact HEAD.

Show actual command and result. A known syntactically broken checkpoint is not
coherent; fix it or preserve an explicit patch/blocker.

## 5. Commit explicit files

Present the file grouping, then execute unless `--dry-run`.

- Stage named paths only; never `git add .` or `git add -A`.
- Use the repository's message/body convention.
- Preserve review/fixup history honestly while a PR is open.
- Do not rewrite published/shared history without verified owned restack
  authority and explicit force-with-lease.

After each successful commit, record focused evidence through:

```bash
python3 "$DELIVERY_PY" checkpoint \
  --id "<id>" --command "<command>" --result "<result>"
```

When `--candidate` is requested, record complete evidence after the final
commit:

```bash
python3 "$DELIVERY_PY" candidate \
  --id "<id>" --head-sha "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --command "<full commands>" --result "<result>"
```

Any subsequent commit invalidates candidate evidence.

## 6. Publish only when authorized

`--publish` is task authority to push the current owned topic branch, not to
push a default/shared/protected branch, open a PR, merge, or delete anything.

Without `--publish`, push only if the active delivery already records
`task-request`/`repository-policy`. Otherwise report the local checkpoint and
the exact publication action still pending.

Before push, verify remote name, upstream, branch ownership, and remote head.
Use an explicit refspec when setting a new upstream. Never let `git push`
default to the tracked default branch. Never plain-force.

If the checkout cannot commit, use delivery `preserve-ref` or `export-patch`
and report why. “Done with uncommitted changes” is not a completion state.

## Output

Report commit SHA/message, files, focused/candidate evidence, branch/upstream,
whether publication occurred and under what authority, active delivery id, and
the next required transition. Do not claim PR-ready without exact candidate
evidence and remote checks.

## Codex surface adapter

# Codex surface adapter

- Installed Clade plugin skills are namespaced. Invoke this workflow as
  `$clade:delivery`, and use `$clade:<skill-name>` for companion workflows.
- Read the closest applicable agent instructions. Codex probes
  `AGENTS.override.md` before `AGENTS.md` at each scope and does not merge
  them, so where an override exists that scope's `AGENTS.md` is not in effect.
  `CLAUDE.md` is Clade's legacy fallback rather than a filename Codex resolves;
  read it only when it is trusted repository guidance.
- Codex-managed worktrees may begin at detached HEAD. A local detached commit
  is valid, but create/attach an owned branch or preserve a reachable Clade ref
  before the runtime deletes the worktree.
- Inspect `git worktree list --porcelain` before checkout, rewrite, or cleanup:
  one branch cannot be checked out by multiple worktrees.
- Use Codex native review/worktree/handoff capabilities where available. Do
  not launch Claude Code or a nested Codex CLI to emulate the workflow.
- Project configuration is trust-gated. Provider credentials and user
  connections remain user-scoped and cannot be donated by repository files.

## Additional skill reference

# Commit

Create one or more truthful checkpoint commits on an owned delivery branch.
Discover repository message, signing, DCO, hook, and verification policy before
committing. A commit preserves work; it does not automatically authorize push,
PR publication, merge, or branch deletion.

This skill is the BUILD/checkpoint operation of `$clade:delivery`. Run the shared
delivery context probe and use its active record rather than assuming
`origin/main`, GitHub, branch ownership, or a writable attached checkout.

## Delivery completion

If this workflow changes files or external state:

- Inspect the real final state before responding, including `git status` for a
  repository task.
- Never report `DONE` while task-owned changes are uncommitted. Use or continue
  `$clade:delivery` and create a repository-compliant checkpoint or preserve
  the work when committing is unavailable.
- When the user request or trusted repository policy makes publication,
  deployment, or live verification part of the task, do not silently downgrade
  the result to local-only work.
- If a required delivery transition lacks authority, credentials, a destination,
  or reachable external state, report `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_CONTEXT` rather than
  appending a "not committed/pushed/deployed" caveat after `DONE`.
