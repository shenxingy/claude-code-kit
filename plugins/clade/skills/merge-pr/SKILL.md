# Clade for Codex

This package composes the provider-neutral Clade core contract with the native
Codex surface adapter. Run the workflow directly in Codex; do not launch
another agent CLI or route it through Clade MCP.

Package provenance:

- core contract: `clade.delivery/v1`
- surface adapter: `codex/v1`
- explicit invocation: `$clade:merge-pr`
- generated from: `configs/skills/<name>`

## Canonical Clade workflow

You are the Merge PR integrator. Use the shared `delivery` controller and the
target forge's live policy. Do not hard-code squash, GitHub, `main/master`, or
remote branch deletion.

## Arguments

- PR number/URL or current branch PR
- `--strategy auto|squash|rebase|merge` (default `auto`)

## 1. Re-probe and resolve the delivery

Locate/read the sibling `delivery` skill and relevant surface overlay. Run its
context and state commands. Re-query the live PR and repository immediately
before integration.

Require explicit merge authority in the active delivery or repository
automation policy. An authoring agent cannot count its own review as
independent approval and cannot infer integration authority from “ship”,
“commit”, or “open a PR”.

If no matching delivery exists, construct a read-only context and require the
same exact-SHA/candidate evidence before creating a state record. Never weaken
the gates just because the PR predates Clade state.

## 2. Atomic scope and repository gates

Inspect the PR diff, commits, base/head, reviews, conversations, rulesets,
required checks, merge queue/auto-merge policy, and live child PRs.

Never merge a multi-feature PR; split it with `$clade:create-pr` first. Supporting
tests/migrations/generated files/docs remain with their behavior.

Block—not warn—when:

- any required check is pending, failing, cancelled, or unavailable;
- required review/CODEOWNERS/conversation gates are unresolved;
- PR is draft, conflicting, closed, or not mergeable;
- base/head changed after candidate/review evidence;
- branch/rules policy discovery fails for an external mutation;
- the requested merge method is disabled;
- parent ancestry would be rewritten while live children lack a safe restack.

There is no conversational override for a red/pending protected gate. Do not
use admin bypasses, `--no-verify`, or unsupported confirmation flags.

## 3. Lock READY and choose history semantics

Run:

```bash
python3 "$DELIVERY_PY" ready \
  --id "<id>" --pr "<number-or-url>" \
  --strategy auto|squash|rebase|merge
```

The controller verifies the recorded candidate SHA equals the current PR head,
requires completed successful checks, discovers enabled methods and child PRs,
and emits one exact command containing:

```text
--match-head-commit <reviewed-head-sha>
```

`auto` chooses only when the history semantics are unambiguous:

- **rebase**: one verified commit when repository policy permits, avoiding a
  needless commit rewrite;
- **merge commit**: shared/live stack ancestry must be preserved;
- **the sole enabled method**: repository policy leaves no semantic choice;
- **stop**: a multi-commit PR has several allowed methods. Inspect its commits,
  then explicitly choose rebase for curated mainline units, squash for
  disposable/checkpoint history, or merge when the PR boundary/topology should
  remain visible.

Merge queues and auto-merge are repository integrations, not bypasses. Use the
native queue when required; otherwise execute exactly the emitted strategy and
head lock.

## 4. Record and repair descendants

After forge confirmation, retrieve the actual landed commit and record:

```bash
python3 "$DELIVERY_PY" merged \
  --id "<id>" --head-sha "<locked-head>" \
  --merge-sha "<landed-sha>" --strategy "<actual-strategy>"
```

For stacks, merge bottom-up. If a parent was squash/rebase merged, every child
must be retargeted/restacked onto current base, pushed only with an explicit
force-with-lease matching freshly fetched remote SHA on its owned branch, and
fully retested. Never claim the stack healthy based on pre-parent evidence.

## 5. Cleanup is part of completion

Resolve the real default branch and remote; do not assume names.

1. Switch to default branch only after confirming the current checkout is clean.
2. Fetch/prune and update with `--ff-only`.
3. Verify the landed PR/commit is reachable.
4. Remove only this delivery's worktree/local branch.
5. Delete the remote branch only under explicit/repository authority.
6. Repair/retest children.
7. Run:

```bash
python3 "$DELIVERY_PY" verify-clean --id "<id>"
```

If squash/rebase makes the source branch not an ancestor of default, an exact
force-delete is allowed only after the forge reports merged, the landed diff is
verified, and the branch lease belongs to this delivery. Report that it was
deleted after squash rather than pretending safe `-d` ancestry applies.

Completion requires clean tree, default branch checked out, local/remote
default exactly aligned, no local/remote topic branch, descendants repaired,
and the delivery state `CLEAN`.

## Codex surface adapter

# Codex surface adapter

- Installed Clade plugin skills are namespaced. Invoke this workflow as
  `$clade:delivery`, and use `$clade:<skill-name>` for companion workflows.
- Read the closest applicable agent instructions. Codex probes
  `AGENTS.override.md` before `AGENTS.md` at each scope and does not merge
  them, so where an override exists that scope's `AGENTS.md` is not in effect.
  `CLAUDE.md` is Clade's legacy fallback rather than a filename Codex resolves;
  read it only when it is trusted repository guidance.
- Codex-managed worktrees may begin at detached HEAD. A local detached commit
  is valid, but create/attach an owned branch or preserve a reachable Clade ref
  before the runtime deletes the worktree.
- Inspect `git worktree list --porcelain` before checkout, rewrite, or cleanup:
  one branch cannot be checked out by multiple worktrees.
- Use Codex native review/worktree/handoff capabilities where available. Do
  not launch Claude Code or a nested Codex CLI to emulate the workflow.
- Project configuration is trust-gated. Provider credentials and user
  connections remain user-scoped and cannot be donated by repository files.

## Additional skill reference

# Merge PR

Integrator workflow for an already reviewed Clade delivery. It never treats
authorship as merge authority, never bypasses pending/red gates, locks the
reviewed head SHA, respects repository merge policy and live child ancestry,
and does not finish until mainline/branch cleanup is verified.

## Delivery completion

If this workflow changes files or external state:

- Inspect the real final state before responding, including `git status` for a
  repository task.
- Never report `DONE` while task-owned changes are uncommitted. Use or continue
  `$clade:delivery` and create a repository-compliant checkpoint or preserve
  the work when committing is unavailable.
- When the user request or trusted repository policy makes publication,
  deployment, or live verification part of the task, do not silently downgrade
  the result to local-only work.
- If a required delivery transition lacks authority, credentials, a destination,
  or reachable external state, report `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_CONTEXT` rather than
  appending a "not committed/pushed/deployed" caveat after `DONE`.
