# test-pre-tool-guardian.sh — Tests for configs/hooks/pre-tool-guardian.sh
#   (PreToolUse Bash: block catastrophic / irreversible shell commands)
#
# Pipes fixture hook-input JSON through the hook and asserts the allow/block
# verdict. Nothing is ever executed — the hook only inspects the command
# string, so these fixtures are inert text.
#
# The catastrophic-rm rule is the focus. It must stay sharp in BOTH
# directions, and the regression it guards is real: matching per LINE blocked
# `SRC=/home/me/.claude; rm -rf /tmp/shadow-test`, a benign temp delete that
# merely shared a line with a home path. Shell one-liners chain statements
# with ; && || far more often than they use newlines, so the rule matches per
# STATEMENT and every condition must be met by the same statement.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/test-pre-tool-guardian.sh        # Run all tests
#   bash tests/test-pre-tool-guardian.sh -v     # Verbose mode

# ─── Delete targets an agent actually writes ─────────────────────────
#
# The rule above matches the TEXT of the target, so it blocks what a human
# types and allowed everything an agent writes. Measured 2026-09-05: every
# case in this section was ALLOW on both guardians while the spelled-out
# forms were blocked.
#
# The reason it matters is the shell lifecycle, not the regex. Every Bash tool
# call is a fresh shell, so a variable assigned in an earlier call is unset in
# this one and a delete against "$BUILD_DIR"/ expands to the filesystem root —
# the exact string the true-positive section above asserts a BLOCK for. GNU
# rm's --preserve-root does not help: the expanded argument is root-plus-star.
#
# The answer is the shape already in this hook for force-push: answer
# {"decision":"allow","updatedInput":...} and hand back a command that is safe
# to run. ${NAME:?...} runs unchanged when NAME is set and aborts naming
# itself when it is not, so the fix costs a correct command nothing.
